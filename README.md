# MEAN Stack Playground 🛠️🌐  

This repository is a **sandbox for experimenting with the MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js). It serves as a playground for testing ideas, building prototypes, and exploring the stack's capabilities.

---

## Features ✨  

- **MongoDB Integration**: Experiment with database models and queries.  
- **Express.js Backend**: Test API routes and middleware functionality.  
- **Angular Frontend**: Build and test dynamic, responsive interfaces.  
- **Node.js Server**: Run and manage the backend services efficiently.  

---

## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- Node.js (14+ recommended)  
- MongoDB installed locally or accessible remotely  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mean-playground.git  
cd mean-playground  

2. Install dependencies:  
npm install  

3. Set up MongoDB:  
Ensure MongoDB is running and update the `config.js` file with the database URI.  

4. Start the application:  
npm start  

---

## Usage 🔧  

- Access the backend API at `http://localhost:3000`.  
- Open the Angular frontend in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.  

### Example Scripts  
- **Run Backend**:  
  node server.js  

- **Run Frontend**:  
  ng serve  

---

## File Structure 📂  

- `server.js`: Main backend file for Node.js and Express.  
- `src/`: Angular frontend source code.  
- `models/`: Mongoose models for MongoDB.  
- `routes/`: Express API routes.  
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.  

---

## Customization 🔧  

1. **Database Models**: Update `models/` to define new MongoDB schemas.  
2. **API Routes**: Add or modify routes in `routes/`.  
3. **Angular Components**: Extend functionality by creating new components in the `src/` directory.
